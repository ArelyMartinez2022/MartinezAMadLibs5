MAD LIBS #5

THIS PROGRAM WILL ASK USERS FOR NOUNS, VERBS, ADJECTIVES, ETC. ONCE THEY ENTER SAID THING IT WILL SHOW UP IN THE TERMINAL AS A SENTENCE WITH THE MULTIPLE INPUTS THEY ENTERED. AT THE END OF PROGRAM THE TERMIAL WILL ASK THE USER IF THEY WANT TO PLAY AGAIN. IF THEY ENTER ANY VERIATION OF YES THE PROGRAM WILL REPLAY.AND VISE VERSA FOR NO. HOWEVER IF THEY DONT ENTER ANYTHING BUT THAT IT WILL ASK THE USER OVER AGAIN UNTIL THEY ENTER IN YES OR NO.

PEER REVIEW: Jasmine Leek // program runs as expected under all conditions tested, nice work.
You might consider using title/sentence case for better user accessibility
